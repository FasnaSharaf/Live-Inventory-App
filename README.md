# WAGGLE

## About the project
This project was made by my team DevDeck (FasnaSharaf, Prithvij2004, S-HARI-S, sreelakshmisatheesh) for Latency 2.O, a national level hackathon conducted by IEDC and Tinkerhub. Out of 530+ participants, our team managed to secure a position within 10. We thought of further developing it and its an ongoing project.

## Problem Statement

“The rich got richer; the poor mostly stayed poor. And the gap widened. Today, the richest 10% in India controls 80% of the nation's wealth!..” Studies also show that “ India has the highest shop density in the world and about 70 million small merchants who collectively control almost 90% of India's retail trade “ ie, we are encircled by many different small-scale retailers but frequently depending on giant-scale markets can diminish the upliftment of poorer sectioned merchants and increase the rich-poor gap.

Secondly, it is an age of instant gratification, where everyone expects everything to be available instantly right away. As a society, we live fast-paced lives, eat fast food, use high-speed internet, and lead fast-paced lifestyles. We do not have the patience to pick up these types of everyday necessities since we are unaware of when and where they will be available. Many people sometimes waste time going to random shops in search of things without knowing the amount, type, or brand they are looking for.

## Solution
To introduce “AN ONLINE PLATFORM THAT PROVIDES LIVE COUNT AND BRAND DETAILS OF EACH ITEM IN THE STORE.” This helps common people to choose the best store with the required quantity near to them. On the other hand, shop owners will get a live idea about which item is liked and brought by the customer most which enhances promoting the best quality product in the market.

## Working
PHASE 1= Users can enter the desired location and essential things they want to buy. The platform will display nearby stores that contain the required commodity and display the live count of that commodity in that particular store. For example, Mr. X requires 2  bread packets at 11.00 pm-midnight. He doesn't know which shops will be open around that time and if some shops are open, he has no idea if the required food will be there or not. He, therefore, enters this platform after giving the location and finds a nearby store, say S1,  within 3 km that contains 5 packets of bread. He can now directly go and buy the same without any rush and thereby reducing fuel consumption and accidents at night. He too can avoid a random selection of stores under simple guesses.

PHASE 2= The count of commodities will be directly updated in the database(liver server) once the digital payment is done. This helps other users to see the live update in the number of items. For example, 2 packets from 5 packets of bread are taken by Mr. X earlier from S1. Suppose the next user, say, Mr. Y, comes into the picture, and the quantity visible in the user interface of Mr. Y  is 3 after the billing is done by Mr. X. This gives an idea about what all items the store is famous for, thereby knowing good products under different brands of the same category. 

PHASE 3= Shop owners will get a chance to realize the best product in the market after analyzing the needs of each customer based on the decrement of the product in the live server. Even though this increases competition among different retailers in the market, thereby ensuring the best product stands out in the market among others. Moreover, every shop will be constantly filling up the items to beat the competitive nature of nearby stores.

## Social Impact
We know India has the highest shop density in the world. We can see a lot of small shop clusters in India. This shows that there is a huge section in our society who meet their daily needs using the small profit they gained from their small business. Most of them may not even have savings. But at the same time, we can also see a lot of very big successful shops of wealthy people who sell the same quality commodities that the small-scale retailers sell but many people prefer to buy from them may be because he/she is unaware of such quality commodities that exist nearby. While doing so, the rich get richer, the poor mostly stay poor and the gap widens. So we aim to uplift poorer sections in a developing country like INDIA and narrow the rich-poor gap. This platform also helps small retailers to get an overall idea of how large-scale retailers run their business and realize the trending products under each category with a single click on their smartphones.
